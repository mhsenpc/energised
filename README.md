A CSMS (charging station management system) such as be.ENERGISED is used to manage charging stations, charging
processes and customers (so-called eDrivers) amongst other things.

One of the most important functionalities of such a CSMS is to calculate a price to a particular charging process so that
the eDriver can be invoiced for the consumed services. Establishing a price for a charging process is usually done by
applying a rate to the CDR (charge detail record) of the corresponding charging process.
